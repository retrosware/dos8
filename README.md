# M$-DOS 8.0 Unofficial Boot floppy image
This is only tested in virtual machines. With configuration 

AOpen AX59 Pro

Intel Pentium MMX 233

128MB memory

1GB Harddrive

If your use this on a physical machine, use it at your own risk.

A lot of patches have been included in the HARD DRIVE version IO.SYS.
The built-in XMS driver has been paritialy disabled, making it to work with HIMEMSX.EXE + EMM386.EXE.

HIMEM.SYS is still not possible, even with /M:2

Win311 patches have been applied.

If you want to install it on harddrive

change to A:

Type 

initc

after booting.

Drive C will be formated. DOS 8.0 will be installed.

I only collect and make this boot disk, hoping it to be useful.
I do not have copyrights of any of the component.
