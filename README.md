# MS-DOS 8.0 Unofficial
## DOS8Boot.img

This is only tested in [virtual machines](https://github.com/86Box/86Box). With configuration 

- AOpen AX59 Pro
- Intel Pentium MMX 233
- 128MB memory
- 1GB Harddrive

If your use this on a physical machine, use it at your own risk.

A lot of patches have been included in the HARD DRIVE version IO.SYS.
The built-in XMS driver has been paritialy disabled, making it to work with HIMEMSX.EXE + EMM386.EXE.

HIMEM.SYS is still not possible, even with /M:2

Win311 patches have been applied.

If you want to install it on harddrive

change to drive A:

Type

```

after booting.
