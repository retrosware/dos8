# MS-DOS 8.0 Unofficial
## DOS8Boot.img

This is only tested in virtual machines. With configuration 

- AOpen AX59 Pro
- Intel Pentium MMX 233
- 128MB memory
- 1GB Harddrive

If your use this on a physical machine, use it at your own risk.

A lot of patches have been included in the HARD DRIVE version IO.SYS.
The built-in XMS driver has been paritialy disabled, making it to work with HIMEMSX.EXE + EMM386.EXE.

HIMEM.SYS is still not possible, even with /M:2

Win311 patches have been applied.

If you want to install it on harddrive

change to drive A:

Type 

```
initc
```

after booting.

Drive C will be formated. MS-DOS 8.0 will be installed.

## DOS8QBasic.img
  
Quick Basic packages

Change to drive A:
type

```

follow instructions.


I only collect and make this boot disk, hoping it to be useful.
I do not have copyrights of any of the component.
